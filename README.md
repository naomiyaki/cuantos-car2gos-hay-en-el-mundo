# ¿Cuantós Car2Gos Hay En El Mundo, cuantós?

If you ever wanted to know (I hear this question a lot, it's a long story), you can go to Wikipedia and check (and do math), or you can run this script!

### How what?
Fist do a little `npm install` in the project directory
Then just run `node car2go.js`

It uses plain ol Node https to get the Wikipedia page and Cheerio to parse the table and then add it together.
